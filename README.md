# Restaurant Page
The Odin Project - Restaurant Page

Well hi people, thanks for making a time to take a look at this project
This is a part of JS assignment project in The Odin Projects.

A bit background on this project, it is a simple restaurant page where you can take a look at the restaurant hompage, menus, and location etc.
This time the purpose of the code is to make separation of JS file in menu, home, and location. This was the first time I use webpack as package manager.

I had fun with the homepage (a bit too much?) but yeah mainly because setting up the video background from youtube with cropped display is a messy work. But nonetheless I made it work as I intended. Displaying video and putting up images on menu definetly increase the load time (that's for another case) but as per right now my concern is to make the page well built.

The challenge when I made this was how to put up the images while you're using package manager as the file would be in different path. Turns out the most convenient way was just to move the src imgs folder into distribution folder so I could easily match the path to the code. 

that's about it, cheers!
